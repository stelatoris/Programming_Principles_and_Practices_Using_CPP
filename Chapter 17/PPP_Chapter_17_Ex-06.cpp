//6. This chapter does not say what happens when you run out of memory
//using new.That’s called memory exhaustion.Find out what happens.You have
//two obvious alternatives : look for documentation, or write a program with
//an infinite loop that allocates but never deallocates.Try both.Approximately
//how much memory did you manage to allocate before failing ? .
